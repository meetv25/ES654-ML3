# Image-Compressor-using-SVD 

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is performed on the individual channels and then used first k entities (rows/cols/singular-values) to generate compressed imaged. 

The project is hosted on HuggingFace at https://huggingface.co/spaces/meetv25/ML/tree/main , where you can directly experiment with it. 

Do check it out, like and star. 

Thanks!
